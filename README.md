# Usage

- Swipe left on a server to delete it
- Press and hold on a server to move it
- Pull down to refresh

# Developement run

Installation of dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Build (recommended)

Create a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) of the app and install it on your device or emulator.
After that you can run the app with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

If you have a device connected and ADB is running, you can start the app by pressing `a` in the terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> This command will start the app via an ngrok tunnel


## Expo Go (does not work with native modules (like the TCP or UDP clients))

```bash
npm run start:go
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command will start the app via an ngrok tunnel

## WSL

If you are using WSL and want to use ADB, you need to set the network mode to "mirrored" in the `.wslconfig` file in your users home directory (on Windows).

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

You also need the [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) and start the adb server with the following command from a PowerShell (Admin):

```powershell
adb start-server
```
